CS230_OperatingPlatforms_FinalProject

I needed to introduce my client, The Gaming Room, to different approaches they can use as they expand their game onto various operating systems. I then explained the integration of the client’s game in a distributed environment. Lastly, I explained how to apply the client’s needs to the architectures of the different operating platforms available.

In developing this documentation, I excelled in thoroughly analyzing every possible environment my client's game could be run on. Each option has aspects that are better or worse than their counterparts. 

Completing the process of working through a design document has helped keep mass amount of data and information organized in a clear, concise fashion. The use of tables and bullet points will make it easy for my client to see the pros and cons of each environment, so the best decision can be made. 

If I could revise and revisit one part of this assignment, it would be describing the mobile environment. It has so many diferent features and aspects that I may have not mentioned. Although some security features are worse for mobile than the other choices, I think I could have found more benfits if I revisit that section. 

When interpretting the users needs, I implemented different sections focussing on the users needs. Security, expenses and flow of operating programming were three factors that I focused on. All three are essential to ensure the launch of Draw It or Lose It is a success.

When designing the software, it was critical to keep coding clear and concise. Diagrams are great tools to present various forms of data in a format that can be understood by people without programming backgrounds. Citing any resources you gathered data from is necessary as well.
